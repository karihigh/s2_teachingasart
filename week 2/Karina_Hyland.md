## SELF - CARE
### SYLLABUS

In the sophomore year at Wenlock High School, health and wellbeing of the community are as important as learning. Students, teachers and staff must attend a total of 6 sessions during the year to learn and practice caring for themselves as well as for others. Each session will be conducted by specialized professionals and will give the essential tools in order to keep everybody on the community healthy in every sense.
They will happen all year round at different times and days so that everyone can fit them into their schedule. The sessions last for 1 hour. They will be divided into lecture time and physical exercises. Each session will take care of either the Critical or Creative Thinking branches of the school. Comfortable clothes are strongly recommended.

In the first session that anyone attends, they will be handed a plant that they need to take care until the last session of this module. They will have to take it home and without any specific directions and using mainly intuition the students will have to make sure that the plant is healthy and by the end of the sessions has grown or improved.

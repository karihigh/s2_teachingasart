#### Target audience
Any adult or elder who has a slight sensibility and curiosity in *mindfulness* or is concerned about not being able to quiet down their mind.

#### Learning objective
Recognize the neural activity of the *default mode network (DMN)*.

#### Learning outcome
The attendants will create awareness of how their minds cycle through the attention and resting states. Build the tools to gain a tiny bit of control over your mind to use for improving attention and therefore mental health.

#### Syllabus

Recent studies in cognitive neuroscience have discovered a complex neural network that activates when not performing a task. Every time the mind wanders and an inner conversation takes place, a series of brain regions work together to achieve some very important mental processes. These regions conform the *default mode network (DMN)*, and its study has become critical for understanding how consciousness operates. This network can be described as mind-wandering, i.e. using past experiences to plan for the future, navigate social interactions, and maximize the utility of moments when we are not otherwise engaged by the external world [.]. Now we know that in order to understand how the brain works depends critically on the study of its intrinsic activity and how it gets us closer to the understanding of consciousness [.].

In this workshop I will present the main principles of this specific neural network and how it can help us on our daily lives. Everyone has experienced some kind of mind wandering, but not all of them are aware that it corresponds to a specific neural network and how to use it for your own benefit.

#### Timeline
Proposed activities and duration of each.

##### 10 min.
Task oriented guided meditation. Body scan, breathing and silent time.

##### 5 min.
Discuss how the meditation went, ask how many people were able to maintain their focus on the directions given. Acknowledge that is difficult to stay focused the whole time. Develop awareness that what we might think is rest, is actually a very energy-consuming activity.

##### 5 min.
Write/sketch down how you picture your brain during this meditation. Images, people, words, colors or anything that passed through the mind. Could be a simple list or an abstract drawing. Keep them to themselves, no need to share.

##### 25 minutes.
Introduce the scientific concepts and biological processes that the brain goes through during a regular day or during a meditation exercise.

Explain the difference between the contents that the mind goes through when the DMN is active. Ask the participants to choose between which day-to-day situation they feel more identified with.
Watch the following example videos of the selected answers.
Reflect on the [videos](https://vimeo.com/229760065) and their impact on the participants.

</p>

##### 15 min.
Fill out a blank cycle diagram with the steps that feel relevant and useful for each person in order to train their minds to maintain focus on whatever feels more comfortable. Keep the diagram and set a goal to perform the designed personal ritual that you may already have or want to pursue.

#### Total duration
60 minutes

#### Materials list and budget
* Screen or projector
* Speakers
* Scrap paper ($ 3.00)
* Colored pens ($ 10.00)
* Possibility to control the lights of the room
* Printed cycle diagram with spaces to fill out ($ 6.00)

##### Total budget: $ 19.00

## ‘REST’ YOUR MIND
### Workshop Proposal

**Duration** 60 minutes

**Target audience**
Any adult or elder between who has a slight sensibility and curiosity in mindfulness or is concerned about not being able to quiet down their mind.

**Learning objective**
Recognize the neural activity of the Default Mode Network.

**Learning outcome**
The attendants will create awareness of how their minds cycle through the attention and resting states. Build the tools to gain a tiny bit of control over your mind to use for improving attention and therefore mental health.


#### Syllabus

10 min.
Task oriented guided meditation. Body scan, breathing and silent time.

5 min.
Discuss how the meditation went, ask how many people were able to maintain their focus on the directions given. Acknowledge that is difficult to stay focused the whole time. Develop awareness that what we might think is rest, is actually a very energy-consuming activity.

5 min.
Write down the things, images, people, words, colors or anything that went passed through the mind. Could be a simple list or an abstract drawing. Keep them to themselves, no need to share.

25 minutes.  
Introduce the scientific concepts and biological processes that the brain goes through during a regular day or during a meditation exercise.
